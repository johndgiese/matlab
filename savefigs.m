function ret = savefigs()
% This function allows you to quickly save all currently open figures with
% a custom filename for each in multiple formats.  To use the function
% simply call savefigs with no arguments, then follow the prompts
%
% Upon execution this function will one-by-one bring each currently open
% figure to the foreground.  Then it will supply a text prompt in the main
% console window asking you for a filename.  It will save that figure to
% that filename in the .fig, .emf, .png, and .eps formats.  
%
% The formats that it saves in can be changed by commenting out or adding
% lines below.
